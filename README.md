radial-spin
=================
###A nav or ui element for your webpage or webapp.

I saw what Josh Parnell (@proceduralguy) is doing with Limit Theory and I wanted some of that UI awesome on my site.
It's far from finished, though the bits I've uploaded kinda /work/.

Thanks to http://creative-punch.net/2014/02/making-animated-radial-menu-css3-javascript/ for the radial menu bits., which made this possible through reverse engineering!

I'd also like to thank the 091 Labs members for helping me grasp the math behind this.

Enjoy!
